Tests:
-----
* Test 2048-FFT processing time

ToDo
-----
* parameter for Rm/Lm estimator: pwm-freq: low/middle/high = 100/200/400 Hz
* pulse-count hysterese via DAC
* after disconnect goto state check?
* curr sometimes not displayed correcly (after calibrate!!)
* settings -> eeprom (pwm, cutoff);
* smooth roll-off after eKm measure
* calibrate UBatt (menu)
* test with crsf-parameter-type > 1byte, e.g. uint16_t

Details:
-----
* pulse-count hysterese (DAC) via DMA
* pulse-count: counting-timer + retriggerable-one-oulse-timer gating

Done:
-----
* check Rm measure (pwm-freq?, saturation?)
* implement PID-controller (use eKm * UBatt * input-duty as control-input)
* for resetting: user confirm
* for calibrating: user confirm
* when calibrating: display different steps
* externer temperatursensor LMT01
* power-on tone
* reset-to-defaults action
* temperatur exp filter
* determine eKm for both directions
* use Rm / eKm for both directions in estimator
* connected: after reset not shown
* run-protection
* select crsf-channel

Rejected:
-----
* fft-Size: 2048, measure processing time -> not enough RAM STM32G473
