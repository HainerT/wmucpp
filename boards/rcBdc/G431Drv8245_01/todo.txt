ToDo
-----
* connected: after reset not shown
* reset-to-defaults action
* after disconnect goto state check?
* curr sometimes not displayed correcly (after calibrate!!)
* settings -> eeprom (pwm, cutoff);
* determine eKm for both directions
* use Rm / eKm for both directions in estimator
* smooth roll-ouff after eKm measure
* calibrate UBatt (menu)
* implement PID-controller (use eKm * UBatt * input-duty as control-input)
* test with crsf-parameter-type > 1byte, e.g. uint16_t
* fft-Size -> 2048, measure processing time

Done:
-----
* run-protection
* select crsf-channel
